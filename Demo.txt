Hello, I'm GhostWriter...
Copy-pasting is great for scripting.
It's simple, fast, and efficient. However...
Typing 1 character at a time is cooler.

Watch me slowly write this top line.
Until you notice how relatively fast this line is typed. (Zooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom)
That's right.
Two line simultaneous output.

So why use GhostWriter? Because I make scripts look cool.
Goodbye.
